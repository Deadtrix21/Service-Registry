# Service-Registry
So, I was working on a project, where Microsoft DI didn't want to work on, and I was so annoyed because the issue was simply that the C# version was too low to use Microsoft DI. To fix, that I couldn't use it, I built a mini version of it, probably not as safe but, it works.

# Solution
I am going to add some sample projects.
Feel free to use however i ask that you do give credit.
